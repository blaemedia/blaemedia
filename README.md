<!-- Introduction -->
### 👨‍💻 About Me  

I'm a **Software Engineer** and **creative technologist** currently enrolled in the **ALX Frontend & Backend Engineering (FE & BE)**, **Frontend ProDev**, and **Backend ProDev** programs.  
My journey into software engineering began with a simple goal:  
to **use programming knowledge to develop products that solve real human problems**.  

Over the years, I’ve gained hands-on experience in **C# (.NET)**, **Java (Spring Boot)**, and **Python (Django)** — combining my engineering skills with creativity from my background in **motion graphics, video editing, and cinematography**.

💡 My mission is to be a **solution provider**, developing **platforms that enable growth, creativity, and real-world impact.**
